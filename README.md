# Teach-Screen
It consists of a toolbar from which the user can select the desired tool from the given options: line, draw, rectangle, circle, and eraser. The user can perform the following action just by closing the fist and only opening the index finger of the hand on the required tool. This selects the tool and then moves the index finger to the desired location on the screen where you want to start drawing from. On reaching that location, open the other fingers of your hand and release when you're done with drawing the shape of the necessary size. The project can have multiple uses in the industry of teaching, especially in online teaching that can help the students learn in a different and interactive way.
